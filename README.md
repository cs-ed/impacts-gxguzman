# Impacts on Society

The name of the module is “Digital Citizenship.” This module will focus on introducing students to navigate the internet safely and equip them with the skills to be. It will be offered to 7th and 8th grade students. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

The purpose of this plan is to introduce students to Digital Citizenship. Currently, I teach Career Explorer and have added the Digital Citizenship Module to our course. The elective is mostly web-based and our district has implemented a one-to-one Chromebook program. The impact of this one-to-one Chromebook program has been positive, as students are able to access the class content without any issues. The one thing that has arisen is the diverse background computer knowledge from students. 

### Learning Activities

Students will work through the Digital Citizenship Module covering several topics. For their final project, students choose one topic they have learned about and create a public service announcement that considers the positive and negative impacts of the topic.
- Digital Footprint and Reputation
- Cyberbullying
- Internet Safety
- Privacy and Security
- Information Literacy
- Creative Credit and Copyright

The public service announcement can be created in the media form the student chooses. 
- video 
- song 
- podcast
- poster 
- slideshow

### Assessment

Students will be assessed on their ability to create the public service announcement on a four point rubric.

4 = Student Completed Public Service Announcement 

3 = Student Completed Most of the Public Service Announcement 

2 = Completed Some of the Public Service Announcement 

1 = Student Start the Public Service Announcement 

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
