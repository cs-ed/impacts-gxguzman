# Impacts on Society

The name of the module is “Digital Citizenship.” This module will focus on introducing students to navigate the internet safely and equip them with the skills to be. It will be offered to 7th and 8th grade students. 

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

The purpose of this plan is to introduce students to Digital Citizenship. Currently, I teach Career Explorer and have added the Digital Citizenship Module to our course. The elective is mostly web-based and many students do not have the experience to sort through the positive and negative social impacts of computing. 

The learning objective for this Digital Citizenship Module is to: 
- Reflect on the positive/negative social impacts of digital citizenship.
- Equip students with the basic skills to be responsible digital citizens.


### Learning Activities

Students will work through the Digital Citizenship Module covering several topics. For their final project, students choose one topic they have learned about and create a public service announcement that considers the positive and negative impacts of the topic.
- Digital Footprint and Reputation
- Cyberbullying
- Internet Safety
- Privacy and Security
- Information Literacy
- Creative Credit and Copyright

The public service announcement can be created in the media form the student chooses. 
- video 
- song 
- podcast
- poster 
- slideshow

### Assessment

Students will be assessed on their ability to create the public service announcement on a four point rubric.

4 = Student Completed Public Service Announcement 

3 = Student Completed Most of the Public Service Announcement 

2 = Completed Some of the Public Service Announcement 

1 = Student Start the Public Service Announcement 

### Outcomes

The outcome for this plan is to instill the knowledge and skills for all students to be able to be safe and ethical as lifetime computer science learners.
